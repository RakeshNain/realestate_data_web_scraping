# realestate_data_web_scraping
The jupyter file contains a detailed description of scraping advertised houses data from domain.com (real estate website) and then wrangling that data.

In any data science project one of the most asked questions is how to get the data, where is the data. I would say there is plenty of data around you, you just need to extract it. For example, on the internet, there are millions of petabytes of data available and most of it is free. All you need to know is how to extract it and make it useful for your organisation. I would say any type of organisation can make use of the free data available on the internet for their business gains. They can use web scraping to extract it.

For demonstrating web scrapping, I will be scraping data from domian.com. Domain.com is a real estate website. I will be scrapping the price, number of bedrooms, number of bathrooms, number of parking, address and location(latitude and longitude) of each house in Melbourne, Australia.
